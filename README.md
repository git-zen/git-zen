### What is Git-Zen?
Git-Zen is a simple yet powerful GitHub integration application for Zendesk. Git-Zen coordinates your Zendesk tickets with your GitHub commits and issues. When a Zendesk ticket arrives, and code needs to be changed to correct the issue, you can now easily see which files needed to be changed to correct the issue right next to the ticket.

Git-Zen makes it easy to look at past tickets and see exactly what GitHub code changes were made to correct the issue, in case further troubleshooting is needed in the future. Git-Zen can also keep your agents separate from your developers, so that you do not need to have Zendesk licenses for your development staff; simply create a new GitHub issue related to the Zendesk ticket directly from within Zendesk.
